# FinalFighter for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch

This is the open source release of FinalFighter for iOS. I'm releasing this source code as open source for your personal entertainment or educational purposes.

The game is also available on the App Store in two versions:

 * [FinalFighter on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finalfighter/id578148499?mt=8) - (git branch master)
 * [FinalFighter Lite on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/tr/app/finalfighter-lite/id583732247?mt=8) - (git branch lite)

The game has been developed with [cocos2d](http://cocos2d.org/). Most of the source code is written in Objective C. The game works with iOS 4.3 or later.

A Mac OSX port is also available in a different repository.
